        <p>我在幾乎所有的社群媒體上都是朋(盆)友 if you realy care about me than why the hell don't you @ me? Don't ask me. Ask yourself. If you don't care about me, than I should be the same person (which is maybe you), why should I treat the same person this makes me looks like shit.
            <br>Put this thing to a few words that you will (maybe) be able to understand. If your the person that I'm targeting, then you should rethink your actions. Treat me like air? I'm going to treat you as air, and not read your messages.
